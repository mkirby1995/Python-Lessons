# Exercise 5: More Variables and Printing
# set 5 of 52, 9.6%

my_name = 'Mathew D. kirby'
my_age = 22 # not a lie
my_height = 72 # inches
my weight = 220 # lbs
my_eyes = 'green'
my_teeth = 'white'
my_hair = 'brown'

print (f"Lets talk about {my_name}.")
print (f"He's {my_height} inches tall.")
print (f"He's {my_weight} pounds heavy.")
print (f"Actually, thats not too heavy.")
print (f"He's got {my_eyes} eyes, and {my_hair} hair.")
print (f"His teeth are usually {my_teeth} depending on the coffee.")

# this line is tricky, try to get it exactly right
total = my_age + my_height + my_weight
print (f"If I add {my_eyes}, {my_height}, and {my_weight}, I get {total}.")
